# Big-Data-with-SQL

This contains the study resource from the coursera course "Big Data with SQL" https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql/home/welcome , which is the fourth course in the Specialization: Excel to MySQL: Analytics Techniques for Business.

Through this course, I got to learn how relational databases work, how to execute the most useful query and table aggregation statements for business analysts, and practice using those queries with real databases. Businesses are collecting increasing amounts of information with the hope that data will yield novel insights into how to improve businesses, so big data is here to stay!

Feel free to point out any mistakes.
Thanks.
